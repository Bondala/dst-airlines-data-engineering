## üé§ Detailed Talking Points

### Opening Strong
"Today we'll present DST Airlines, a comprehensive data engineering solution that processes real-time flight data at scale. This project demonstrates our mastery of modern data engineering tools and practices."

### Technical Deep Dives

#### Database Architecture Decision
"We chose a polyglot persistence approach because different data types require different storage optimizations. Flight schedules need ACID compliance, which MySQL provides excellently. Flight logs vary in structure, making MongoDB's document model ideal. Route relationships are naturally graph-like, hence Neo4j. And for full-text search across all data, Elasticsearch is unmatched."

#### API Design Philosophy
"Our API follows REST principles with async processing for high throughput. We implemented comprehensive error handling, request validation, and automatic documentation generation. The health check endpoints enable proper monitoring and alerting."

#### Dashboard User Experience
"The dashboard provides real-time insights without requiring technical expertise. Users can explore data through intuitive filters and visualizations. The responsive design ensures accessibility across devices."

### Addressing Business Value
"This solution enables airlines to optimize operations through predictive analytics, improve customer service with real-time updates, and reduce costs through efficient resource allocation."

## ‚ùì Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Model Answers

#### Q: "Why did you choose this specific database architecture?"
**Answer**: "We implemented polyglot persistence where each database serves its strengths. MySQL provides ACID compliance for critical flight schedules, MongoDB offers schema flexibility for varying flight logs, Neo4j enables complex route relationship analysis, and Elasticsearch delivers fast full-text search and analytics."

#### Q: "How do you handle real-time data consistency across multiple databases?"
**Answer**: "We implement eventual consistency with event-driven updates. Critical data like flight schedules use synchronous updates to MySQL, while analytical data uses asynchronous processing. We have conflict resolution strategies and data reconciliation processes."

#### Q: "What happens if the Lufthansa API is unavailable?"
**Answer**: "We've implemented several resilience patterns: circuit breaker to prevent cascade failures, retry logic with exponential backoff, cached data serving for critical information, and graceful degradation with user notifications about data freshness."

#### Q: "How would you scale this system for production?"
**Answer**: "We'd implement horizontal scaling with load balancers, database sharding for high write volumes, Redis cluster for caching, message queues like Apache Kafka for high-throughput data ingestion, and container orchestration with Kubernetes."

#### Q: "What security measures have you implemented?"
**Answer**: "JWT token-based authentication, input validation with Pydantic, SQL injection prevention through ORMs, rate limiting to prevent abuse, HTTPS enforcement, and sensitive data encryption. We also implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure."

#### Q: "How do you monitor system health and performance?"
**Answer**: "We have comprehensive health checks for each service, metrics collection with Prometheus, visualization with Grafana, log aggregation with ELK stack, and automated alerting for critical failures."

### Technical Challenge Questions

#### Q: "Explain your data modeling decisions"
**Answer**: "We normalized flight schedules in MySQL for consistency, denormalized flight logs in MongoDB for query performance, modeled airports and routes as nodes and relationships in Neo4j for path finding algorithms, and structured documents in Elasticsearch for faceted search."

#### Q: "How do you ensure data quality?"
**Answer**: "Multi-layer validation: API response validation, Pydantic model validation, database constraints, data quality monitoring with automated alerts, and regular data quality reports. We also implement data lineage tracking."

#### Q: "What was your biggest technical challenge?"
**Answer**: "Managing data consistency across multiple databases while maintaining performance. We solved this through event sourcing patterns, implementing saga patterns for distributed transactions, and careful consideration of consistency requirements per use case."
